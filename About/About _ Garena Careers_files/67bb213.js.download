Such third parties may include, without limitation: <br>\n<br>\n•\tOur subsidiaries, our parent company, affiliates and related corporations; <br>\n•\tContractors, agents, service providers and other third parties we use to support our business. These include but are not limited to those which provide administrative or other services to us such as mailing houses, telecommunication companies, analytics services, advertising and marketing partners, information technology companies and data centres; \n•\tIn connection with business transactions; <br>\n•\tGovernment or law enforcement officials or private parties as we, in our sole discretion, believe necessary or appropriate to respond to legal claims and legal processes, protect our rights and/or the rights of other third parties, and/or to prevent or address any activity we consider unlawful, unethical or legal actionable; and<br>\n•\tThird parties to whom disclosure by us is for one or more of the Purposes and such third parties would in turn be collecting and processing your personal data for one or more of the Purposes. <br>\n<br>\n8.2.\tFor the avoidance of doubt, in the event that Privacy Laws or other applicable laws permit an organisation such as us to collect, use or disclose your personal data without your consent, such permission granted by the laws shall continue to apply.

Consistent with the foregoing and subject to applicable law, we may use your personal data for recognized legal grounds including to comply with our legal obligations, to perform our contract with you, to achieve a legitimate interest and our reasons for using it outweigh any prejudice to your data protection rights, or where necessary in connection with a legal claim. <br>\n<br>\n8.3.\tThird parties may unlawfully intercept, or access personal data transmitted to or contained on the Site, technologies may malfunction or not work as anticipated, or someone might access, abuse or misuse information through no fault of ours.

We do not knowingly collect or maintain any personal data or non-personally-identifiable information from anyone under the age of 13 nor is any part of our Site directed to children under the age of 13. We will remove and/or delete any personal data we believe was submitted by any child under the age of 13. In some jurisdictions, the age limit may be higher pursuant to applicable laws, in which case we comply with applicable age restrictions. <br>\n<br><div class="title">\n10.\tDISCLAIMER REGARDING SECURITY AND THIRD-PARTY SITES</div>\n10.1.\tWE DO NOT GUARANTEE THE SECURITY OF PERSONAL DATA AND/OR OTHER INFORMATION THAT YOU PROVIDE ON THIRD PARTY SITES.

When you access your personal data, we offer the use of a secure server. All personal data or sensitive information you supply is encrypted into our databases to be only accessed as stated above. <br>\n<br>\n10.2.\tIn an attempt to provide you with increased value, we may choose various third-party websites to link to, and frame within, the Site. These linked sites have separate and independent privacy policies as well as security arrangements. Even if the third party is affiliated with us, we have no control over these linked sites, each of which has separate privacy and data collection practices independent of us. Data collected by such third-party web sites (even if offered on or through our Site) may not be received by us. <br>\n<br>\n10.3.\tWe therefore have no responsibility or liability for the content, security arrangements (or lack thereof) and activities of these linked sites. These linked sites are only for your convenience and you therefore access them at your own risk.

All personal data or sensitive information you supply is encrypted into our databases to be only accessed as stated above. <br>\n<br>\n10.2.\tIn an attempt to provide you with increased value, we may choose various third-party websites to link to, and frame within, the Site. These linked sites have separate and independent privacy policies as well as security arrangements. Even if the third party is affiliated with us, we have no control over these linked sites, each of which has separate privacy and data collection practices independent of us. Data collected by such third-party web sites (even if offered on or through our Site) may not be received by us. <br>\n<br>\n10.3.\tWe therefore have no responsibility or liability for the content, security arrangements (or lack thereof) and activities of these linked sites. These linked sites are only for your convenience and you therefore access them at your own risk.
